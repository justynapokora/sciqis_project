# Random Circuits: Expressibility & Entangling Capability

Reproduction of the random circuit study from [Sim et al.](https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qute.201900070) 
using an implementation of a quantum circuit simulator. As an extension to the study results for ideal and noisy 
circuit are compared, implemented noise channels:
- Depolarizing Channel, 
- Preparation and Measurement (SPAM) Channel
- Thermal Decoherence and Dephasing Channel

File *random_circuit.ipynb* contains some definitions, examples and generated results.
